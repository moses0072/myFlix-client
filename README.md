# myTopFilms
 
# Objective:

Is to built the client side using React - Redux to display the data from 
my backend Movie API. The project will utilize a single-page application 
with state routing to navigate between views and share URLs.

## How it works:

1. **Users could Register and login**
<div align='center'>

</div>

2. **After login users could see lot of films and their description**
    * They could search for a movie by title.
    * They could view the details of each Movie.
    * They could add movies to their favorite list.

</div>
