# myTopFilms
 
# Objective:

Is to built the client side using React - Redux to display the data from 
my backend Movie API. The project will utilize a single-page application 
with state routing to navigate between views and share URLs.

## How it works:

1. **Users could Register and login**
<div align='center'>
<img src='https://github.com/moses0072/myFlix-client/blob/final/images/log_reg.png' alt='Alt text' title='Register or login' style='max-width:100%'>
</div>

2. **After login users could see lot of films and their description**
    * they could search for a film by title.
